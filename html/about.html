			<!-- Actual substance that is "about us" -->
			<p> We are a mom and son who are just trying to make some money in a pandemic by <br> renting out a backyard.</p>

			<p>	Neither of us have ever been trained or educated on how to run a business in <br> 
				any way. But then COVID-19 hit and we saw the creative ways that people were <br> 
				getting income during such a hard time. We decided that we wanted a slice <br>
				of the pie. We didn't need the money, we just wanted it. So here we are.</p>

			<p>	Mom's starting to kinda... <i> lose it... </i> so Noah will be your primary contact. </p>

			<p> A date, time, and event package can be discussed over email, text, or call. </p>
